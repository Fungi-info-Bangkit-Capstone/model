# ML-Fung.info

## Summary

Fung.info is an app that detects and classify a fungi or mushroom types. We use Tensorflow as we build the model using CNN, where this method is one type of Machine Learning that commongly used for image data. We utilize CNN to do the Image Classification to determine the fungi types and use a pre-trained model called MobileNetV3(Large) to cover a wide range of image classification and to have a small sized model. 

This repository mainly consists of 3 (three) files:
1. 'MobileNet Model.ipynb' is the notebook files of this project
2. 'label.txt' is used to store a list of labels or classes used in classification task
3. 'model3.tflite' is the converted model to use in the mobile app
